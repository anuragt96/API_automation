# API Automation

In this project I have practiced on the basic CRUD operations on the Restful booker API collection and handled all the events.

## Handling payload of the API

In order to handled the API payload it is very complex to handle large no of payload as an objects and arrays.

So in API Automation basically there are 3 ways through which we can handle the payloads

- Using the String datatype
- Using the Hashmaps
- Using the POJO Classes (Plain old java objects)

### We are using multiple maven repos

- Rest Assured
- GSON
- Jackson
- Allure Reports
- TestNG (Test Next Generation)
